Overview
--------

This project implements a sophisticated multi-agent system designed to tackle complex machine learning and software development tasks. The system leverages Claude Sonnet 3.5 as the base model and extends its capabilities through Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Key features include:

- **Hybrid Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents with distinct roles and expertise
- **Advanced Memory System**: Short-term, long-term, and agent-specific memory components
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Domain-specific knowledge retrieval
- **Multi-Domain Support**: Computer Vision, NLP, and Tabular data
- **MCP Integration**: Custom tools for extended capabilities
